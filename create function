We've set up the the Owner and Pet models, our table associations, and are now ready for some CRUD operations. First things first - we can't update and delete non-existent data, so we need to create some.

Create

The creating a record takes the following form:

model.create({
  // required columns go here in the form of object properties
})
Let's add a record to the owners table. This is important, because we need an owner_id to include in the pet table when we create pets.

db.owners.create({
  name: 'Loren',
  role: 'admin'
})
.then(newUser => {
  console.log(`New user ${newUser.name}, with id ${newUser.id} has been created.`);
});
Three things to note:

The only valid entries for role are 'user', 'admin', and 'disabled' because that column is an enumerated data type (cf. Owner model lines 15-18).
The .then() is provided to show that, with the exception of deleted_at, all columns of a new owner are returned from the creation operation. This isn't always the case (watch out for the tricky bulkCreate method!).
The id is autogenerated and should not be included as a property during creation.
