Delete

Deleting a record follows the same procedure as finding one. Although we are sending a DELETE HTTP request, the Sequelize method is destroy.

db.pets.destory({
  where: { name: 'Max' }
})
.then(deletedPet => {
  console.log(`Has the Max been deleted? 1 means yes, 0 means no: ${deletedPet}`);
});
As you've probably gathered from the logged out response, Sequelize return a 1 or a 0 indicating the success of the destroy method.
